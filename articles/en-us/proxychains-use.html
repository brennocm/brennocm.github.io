            <p>Proxychains can be an essential tool in the current digital context, where issues of privacy, censorship,
                and security are constantly in evidence, given the possibility of anonymizing internet connections by
                redirecting them through a chain of proxies, masking the user's real IP address.</p>
            <h2>Concepts</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Proxies</b>
                <br><br>
                A proxy is an intermediary server that acts as a point of intermediation between the user's device and
                the destination server, redirecting and managing network traffic. It allows access requests to be
                masked, hiding the user's original IP and assigning a new IP associated with the proxy. In addition to
                providing anonymity, proxies are widely used to bypass access restrictions, balance network loads, and
                monitor traffic.

            <p>
                <b>Proxychains</b>
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://github.com/haad/proxychains">Proxychains</a> is a network traffic redirection tool that
                allows running programs through a chain of proxies, providing greater anonymity and control over
                connections. Its main function is to intercept application network calls and redirect them through
                intermediate servers (proxies), such as SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP(S), which are configured in a specific
                file.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>HTTP/HTTPS</b>
                <br><br>
                HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the communication protocol that allows the exchange of information
                between browsers and servers on the web. It works as a request and response system, where the browser
                requests resources, such as text or images, and the server responds by sending the requested data.
                <br><br>
                HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, which uses encryption through
                the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol to protect transmitted data. This security is essential to
                protect sensitive information, such as passwords and financial data, especially in online transactions.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>SOCKS4/SOCKS5</b>
                <br><br>
                SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 are versions of a proxy protocol that operates at the network transport level,
                redirecting traffic between client and server without interpreting the transmitted data. SOCKS4 only
                supports TCP connections, being mainly used for basic traffic redirection. SOCKS5 is a more advanced
                evolution, with support for TCP and UDP connections, username and password authentication, and
                compatibility with IPv6, making it more versatile for modern applications that require greater
                flexibility and security.

            <p>
                <b>Tor</b>
                <br><br>
                The Tor network (The Onion Router) is a communication network that allows anonymizing internet browsing
                by routing data traffic through a series of nodes (servers) distributed globally. Communication is
                encrypted in multiple layers, like the layers of an onion, ensuring that the origin, destination, and
                content of the data are protected.

            <h2>Hands-on</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Searching for Proxy Lists</b>
                <br><br>
                Searching for proxy lists is essential for the effective functioning of Proxychains, as its operation
                depends directly on the quality and availability of the configured proxies. A reliable and diverse list
                ensures greater anonymity, allowing connections to be routed through multiple intermediate servers and
                making traffic tracking difficult. It is worth noting that proxy servers can see the connection, but
                what they can observe depends on the type of proxy and the protocol used.
                <br><br>
                An <b>HTTP proxy</b> can see all the content of unencrypted requests and responses, such as URLs,
                headers, and transmitted data. In the case of <b>HTTPS connections</b>, the proxy only sees the domain
                being accessed (via SNI), but not the content, which is protected by TLS encryption.
                <br><br>
                <b>SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies</b> operate at a lower level, only retransmitting data packets between the
                client and the destination server. They do not interpret the connection content but can see the
                communication metadata, such as the source and destination IP addresses.
                <br><br>
                Even in encrypted connections (such as HTTPS or VPNs), the final proxy, which forwards the traffic to
                the destination, can record information such as the client's IP address, connection times, and the
                volume of transmitted data. Therefore, trust in the proxy operator is crucial to ensure privacy and
                security.
                <br><br>
                In sensitive networks, using tools like TOR can help mitigate these risks by adding additional layers of
                anonymity.
                <br><br>
                For study purposes, proxies found in this <a
                    href="https://github.com/TheSpeedX/PROXY-List">proxy-list</a> were used. However, it is not
                recommended to use it for non-educational purposes, as it does not ensure any security and reliability.
                <br><br>

            <p>
                <b>Installing Tor</b>
                <br><br>
                Using Tor in conjunction with the Proxychains tool is essential to increase anonymity and security in
                network connections. While Proxychains allows chaining multiple proxies, TOR adds a robust layer of
                anonymization by routing them through its distributed network, composed of volunteer nodes that make
                tracing the origin and destination of traffic difficult.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, to install Tor, with administrative permissions, use the command below:
            </p>
            <pre class="code-block">
                <code>sudo apt install tor -y</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                After installation, verify if the service is active:
            </p>
            <pre class="code-block">
                <code>systemctl status tor</code>
            </pre>
            <img id="main" src="../../img/articles/proxychains-use/05-tor-usage.png" alt="05-tor-usage">
            <p>
                <b>Installing Proxychains</b>
                <br><br>
                To install the Proxychains tool, with administrative permissions, use the command below:
            </p>
            <pre class="code-block">
                <code>sudo apt install proxychains4</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                To validate your installation, type the command <i>proxychains4</i> in the terminal and wait for the
                tool's default response.

                <br><br>
                <b>Understanding Proxychains</b>
                <br><br>
                Proxychains configuration is done through the default definition file, located at
                <b>/etc/proxychains4.conf</b>. This file defines how the tool operates, allowing 4 proxy management
                options, which are:
                <br><br>
                <b>Dynamic Chain</b>: With this configuration, the tool will attempt to use proxies in the listed order.
                However, if a proxy fails, it will be skipped and the tool will move on to the next one.
                <br><br>
                <b>Strict Chain</b>: Each proxy is used in the listed order, from first to second, third, and so on. If
                a proxy fails, the entire connection will be interrupted.
                <br><br>
                <b>Round-Robin Chain</b>: Chained proxies are used in a circular fashion to distribute connections among
                the provided proxies. Each connection request goes to the next one in the list, and upon reaching the
                end, starts again at the beginning.
                <br><br>
                <b>Random Chain</b>: As the name suggests, this configuration randomly selects proxies for each
                connection. It does not follow a specific order and creates a unique path each time the tool is
                executed.
                <br><br>
                The choice of management type depends on the need, such as:
                <br><br>
                <b>Anonymity</b>: Random Chain can provide greater anonymity by choosing proxies randomly.
                <br><br>
                <b>Reliability</b>: Dynamic Chain offers resilience by ignoring proxies that fail, thus ensuring
                connection stability.
                <img id="main" src="../../img/articles/proxychains-use/04-proxychain-config.png"
                    alt="04-proxychain-config">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Proxy Configuration</b>
                <br><br>
                For its use, configuration through the Tor network or an <b>extremely</b> reliable proxy server is
                recommended. For configuration, simply add, in the format <b>"PROTOCOL" "IP" "PORT"</b> at the end of
                the file, the chosen proxy, for example:
                <img id="main" src="../../img/articles/proxychains-use/06-proxychain-usage.png"
                    alt="06-proxychain-usage">
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Usage with Tor</b>
                <br><br>
                To use with Tor, simply, with the Tor service activated locally, redirect the proxy to itself with the
                indicator <b>socks5 127.0.0.1 9050</b>
                <img id="main" src="../../img/articles/proxychains-use/07-tor-usage.png" alt="07-tor-usage">
                To validate its use, use the command <b>proxychains4 firefox</b> in the terminal to open the browser
                under the tool, and access <a href="https://check.torproject.org/">https://check.torproject.org/</a>
            </p>
            <img id="main" src="../../img/articles/proxychains-use/08-tor-usage.png" alt="08-tor-usage">
            <b>Using Proxychains with Tools</b>
            <br><br>
            To redirect traffic from other programs to proxychains, simply enter in the terminal the command
            <b>proxychains TOOL_NAME</b>, for example:
            </p>
            <img id="main" src="../../img/articles/proxychains-use/09-proxychain-usage.png" alt="09-proxychain-usage">
            <p>
                <b>Extra: proxy_dns</b>
                <br><br>
                The proxy_dns configuration, present in <b>proxychains4.conf</b>, requests DNS resolution through the
                proxy chain. This is important for maintaining anonymity, as it prevents DNS leaks that could reveal the
                real IP address through DNS queries not routed through the proxy. To validate if there are DNS leaks in
                your connection, access <a href="https://dnsleaktest.com">https://dnsleaktest.com</a>.
