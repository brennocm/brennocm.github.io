            <h2>About the Exam</h2>
            It is a 60-question multiple-choice exam with 60 minutes available for completion. If the candidate scores
            more than 60%, they will pass and become certified. If they score more than 80%, their certification will
            include "with merit", evidencing the high percentage of correct answers. The exam covers all topics
            mentioned in its scope, with questions ranging from proposed scenario analysis to explanation of specific
            AWS services.
            <br><br>
            During the exam, camera and microphone access is required for physical environment validation and to prevent
            actions that violate the exam's code of ethics.
